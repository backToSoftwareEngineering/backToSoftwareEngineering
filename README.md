# Žygimantas Širvys | Data Engineering Learning Journey

---

## About me

Hi – I’m Žygimantas. I’m not a data engineer yet, but I’m working toward it step by step. 
Right now I’m focused on closing the skill gap between where I am and what’s needed to land an entry-level data engineering job. I’m building this portfolio to track what I’ve learned and where I’ve improved.

## What I’m learning & working on

- Building **Entity-Relationship diagrams** from business descriptions

- Practicing **SQL** (joins, window functions, CTEs, data cleaning)

- Designing relational **database schemas**

- Writing **Python** code for data pipelines

- Slowly introducing myself to **Airflow**

---

## Key skills (in progress)

-  SQL – queries, data cleaning, normalization, db schema

-  Python – scripting, basic OOP

-  Database modeling – ERDs from scratch, translating business cases into tables and keys
